# Aircraft Damage Detection and Repair Recommendation Tool

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive web application for detecting damage on aircraft surfaces and identifying faulty wires in harnesses. Leveraging advanced imaging and analysis techniques, the tool provides accurate damage assessment and repair recommendations. Key functionalities include repair recommendations generation, faulty wire location identification, damage assessment using machine learning algorithms, image analysis, CAD 3D projection, and a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Repair Recommendations**: Generate repair recommendations based on assessed damage and faulty wire locations.
- **Faulty Wire Location Identification**: Implement algorithms to identify and locate faulty wires within aircraft harnesses.
- **Damage Assessment**: Employ machine learning algorithms to assess damage severity and extent on aircraft surfaces.
- **Image Analysis**: Utilize advanced imaging algorithms to analyze high-resolution images of aircraft surfaces and wire harnesses.
- **CAD 3D Projection**: Develop algorithms for CAD 3D modeling to project identified paths of damage or faulty wiring.
- **Web Application**: Build a responsive web application for end-users to interact with the tool.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: Python Flask for server-side logic.
- **AI/ML**: Utilize machine learning algorithms for image analysis and damage assessment.
- **CAD**: Implement CAD 3D modeling for projecting damage locations.
- **Other**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Axios for API requests, jsPDF for PDF generation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aircraft-damage-detection.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd aircraft-damage-detection
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Web Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Select an aircraft image for analysis. Ensure the image size is less than 2MB.
2. **Submit Image**: Click the "Submit" button to initiate the image processing.
3. **View Analysis Results**: Once processed, view the analysis results, including crack presence, number of cracks, and repair recommendations.
4. **Download PDF Report**: Optionally, download a PDF report summarizing the crack analysis.
5. **See Repair Recommendations**: Access repair recommendations based on the analysis.
6. **Explore Cracked Images**: Explore additional cracked images for further analysis.
